Table: Equivalence of spatially explicit parameters $m$ and $\alpha$ (Mean dispersal distance) with spatially implicit neutral parameters $\theta$, $I$ and  non-spatial $m$.  We used the formulas 1a & 1b from Etienne & Rosindell (2011) that assume a fat tailed dispersal kernel and $128^2$ individuals.

Table: Proportion of best models for patch size distributions from simulated neutral/niche model communities. We fitted the distribution of patches of the species with the largest patch (MaxPatch) or the spanning patch (Spanning). We used 3 models: exponential (Exp), power law (Pow) and power law with exponential cutoff (PowExp), when there is not enough number of patches we did not fit any model (NoModel). The best model was selected using the Akaike information criteria. We made 30 simulations in a range of $\rho$ (see methods) and we used the following parameters: metacommunities have 64 species and two different species abundance distributions: logseries and uniform SAD. The size of the grid was 512*512 sites, migration=0.0001, and dispersal distance=26.66.

\caption{Largest patch for a spatial neutral/niche model as a function of the intensity of competition $\rho$. The columns represent two different metacommunity types: Logseries, a metacommunity with logseries species abundance distribution (SAD); Uniform, a metacommunity with a uniform SAD. The rows represent the largest patch relative to total area $S_{max}$ and the largest patch relative to the species area $RS_{max}$. The vertical line is the critical point, which is the value for parameter $\rho$ where a phase transition between neutral and niche phases occurs. The parameters used were: side of the simulation lattice was 256 sites, the number of species in the metacomunity was 320, the metacommunity migration $m$=0.0001 and the dispersal distance = 26.66.}

\caption{Rank abundance diagrams (RADs) for simulated neutral/niche model communities as a function of the intensity of competition $\rho$. Except for $\rho=0$ the values in the legend are upper limits. The RADs are averages of 50 simulations. Metacommunities have 320 species and two different species abundance distributions (SAD): logseries SAD (L); and uniform SAD (U); the black line with $\rho=0.0002$ is the closest SAD previous to the critical point. The size of the grid was 256*256 sites and the other parameters used are  the migration rate $m$=0.0001, and dispersal distance=26.66.}

We show the exponents of the two models selected by the Akaike criterion: the power law (Pow) and a power law with exponential cutoff. The continuous lines unite the medians for each $\rho$. The patch size distribution corresponds to the species that has the largest patch or the species that percolate and form a spanning cluster.

We simulated communities in the same time span than the simulations to determine the critical point---typically around 20000 time steps---we take the last 5000 and measure the patch sizes each 100 time steps. The communities that did not have a spanning patch were classified as "Before" the critical point, with a range of $\rho: 0 - 0.0004$. The communities that present a spanning patch in all the times are measured as "After" the critical point, with $\rho: 0.0004 - 1$. The communities where the spanning patch appears and disappears were classified as "Near" the critical point, with  $\rho: 0.0002 - 0.0004$.
