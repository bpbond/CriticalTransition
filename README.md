# Biodiversity collapse in a phase transition between neutral and niche communities

Markdown version of the manuscript and R source code for the data analysis. 

**ctnhm.md** the manuscript in markdown 

**ctnhm.bib** the bibliography

**ctnhm_appendices.md** Apendices


To reproduce the results you need to compile the following C++ program available at <https://github.com/lsaravia/Neutral>:

+ ipsNeutralCont: with power dispersal


## R Markdown files:

I usually run Rmd files chunk by chunk because there are long simulations, and save ".RData" to keep the results.
  
**Neutral_steadyState.Rmd** Simulations to determine the time to reach steady state

**Neutral_simulCT.Rmd** Simulations to find critical values, and plots H vs Rho vs Migration

**Neutral_EarlyWarnings_Smax.Rmd** Early warnings of the critical transition based on Maximun Patch Smax

**BCIpatchAnalysis.Rmd** Barro Colorado Island analysis 

## R functions

R/Neutral_fun.r: collection of functions used for the analysis

R/BCI_fun.r: collection of functions used for the analysis of BCI data

R/powerlaw: code to fit powerlaws from <http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/> (by Cosma Shalizi)
